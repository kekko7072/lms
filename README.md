Link Management System


## Build
### macOS
Run on Debug or Release Mode.

### Windows
Follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvwX-hmYv0E) to build the .exe file. As said in [package instructions](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite_common_ffi#windows) remember that in <b>release mode</b> you need to add the file sqlite3.dll [downlaod](https://github.com/tekartik/sqflite/raw/master/sqflite_common_ffi/lib/src/windows/sqlite3.dll) in same folder as your executable.

### Linux
Never tested.
